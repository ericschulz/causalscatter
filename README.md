## Experiment

This is the html/js-implementation of the experiment. In particular,

- the canvas for causal judgements
- the wrapper to collect data
- the final task

Leo is working on a newer version of the experiment which should be available soon.


## Data

This contains the collected data of our experiments:

- Raw data of participants
- Use data for forecasts
- Scripts to analyze participants

Note: This is still work in progress and we will amend continuously.


## Thesis

Leo will add his proposal here once it's done.
